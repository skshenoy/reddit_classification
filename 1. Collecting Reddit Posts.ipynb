Not to mention how awkward that\\'s going to be that she has a pivotal part in the celebration when she\\'s so new to the group. I\\'d say \"She\\'s invited as a guest. We want her to enjoy the reception, we\\'ll take care of the entertainment\"\\nYou\\'re so obviously NTA this borders on a validation post. Tell them you\\'ve decided to have the DJ play \"Cry Me A River\" instead.\\nNTA, that\\'s a weird ask from someone who doesn\\'t even know you, and the fact that she rejected your (generous) compromise shows that the wedding isn\\'t about you as a couple, it\\'s about her getting to be a star.\\nNTA- it’s YOUR day. Hopefully she won’t be rude the day of\\nNTA. Your wedding, not your dad\\'s gf\\'s audition. She can throw a bbq or something and invite the family is she wants to introduce herself; she shouldn\\'t be piggybacking on one of the most important days of your life for it.\\nNTA. Not much to say here, since your last two sentences are completely correct.\\nNTA\\n\\n\"Reception or nothing\" huh?  Well, looks like \"nothing\" just got added to your reception schedule.\\nNTA, and you are gonna be on a wiiiild ride with new step mommy, sounds like. Looking forward to more ridiculous stories!\\nINFO: Is she like a known professional singer/songwriter or something?\\nNTA you haven\\'t even met her or heard her sing! And it\\'s not fair for you to be given an ultimatum over it. It might not be the best start to your relationship with your dad\\'s gf going forwards, but that\\'s not going to be your biggest concern on your wedding day.\\nNTA. Make your wedding how you want it. If anyone is trying to make your wedding about them, they\\'re TA. Your dad is also the sub-asshole for siding with his girlfriend when this is your wedding!\\nNTA. Tell him that not having a stranger sing at your wedding would make you really happy.\\nNTA \\n\\nYou have never met this woman so it would even be kinda weird to have her sing at your wedding.\\nIf he wants her to sing and be the centre of attention at a party tell him to throw her a karaoke party.\\nYour wedding your special day (and your fiancé’s) end of story.\\n\\nHope you have an amazing wedding and good luck dealing with this situation!\\nNTA\\n\\nIt\\'s your wedding, you get what you want.  She gave you an out tell her \"nothing then\".\\nNTA and rescind his plus one. He\\'s abusing the situation.\\nNTA. Sounds like she just wants the spotlight on her even though this is your special day.\\nShe was a backup singer for Hall &amp; Oates I guess. I think she sings at like a bar or club where she lives. I heard her sing in a birthday fb post to my dad, she sounds good but I wasn\\'t like \\'omg voice of an angel\\'\\nYour wedding. NTA\\nNTA. Your wedding is about you, your future spouse and those closest to you two. \\n If she\\'s a recent gf, who knows if she\\'s even going to be around by the time of your wedding. Even if you loved her singing, it would be a bad idea to use her as a performer.\\nNot famous enough to justify thinking it\\'s some great gift to sing a song at your reception, especially in light of the fact that you\\'ve never even met her. NTA.\\nNTA Sounds like your dad just wants the chance to show off his new gf to everyone and she wants to be that center of attention and ultimately it’s your day and your (and your partners) decision. No one gets to make it for you.\\nNTA\\n\\nNo thanks. Your dad can throw a party for her to sing if he isn’t paying for your wedding and reception.\\nNTA. If her position is \"reception or nothing\" then it\\'s clearly about HER and not YOU.\\nNTA. She sounds like she wants to make this about her and not your special occasion. Girl sounds crazy tbh\\nNTA\\n\\nUnless your dad is dating Mariah Carey and he wants to surprise you during the reception, there\\'s no reason for him to force his girlfriend upon your wedding like that.\\nNTA. It\\'s your wedding. She either comes as a guest or she stays away. Your dad is being a knob\\nNTA. It\\'s your wedding, not Family Idol.  She\\'s definitely making it about herself, otherwise she\\'d want to meet you before the big day.\\nIn fairness it could be the Dad pushing this and not the new girlfriend.\\nNTA. What an odd thing to try and do. It feels like she is fantasizing about everyone loving her for doing this, Dumb and Dumber style. But it\\'s, uh, somebody else\\'s wedding who you haven\\'t even met before.\\n\\nI wish people didn\\'t pressure brides and grooms about wedding planning so much. They\\'re the ones planning it and, well, getting married, so let them design the event however they want!\\nNTA, and be on the lookout for more attention-seeking behavior from her (or your father) at your wedding. Ask one of your wedding party if they wouldn\\'t mind showering her/them with attention prior to and during the reception so they don\\'t make any disturbances. Hopefully, they won\\'t be a pain, but never hurts to be prepared, it\\'s your wedding day! Best wishes, BTW!\\nNTA\\n\\nid go with nothing\\nNTA. Also, it might be a good idea to have a word with whoever will be in control of the microphone (DJ, emcee, whoever) and let them know that someone may try to go off-script, and that you\\'d like to prevent that if at all possible. I\\'m getting \"ambush\" vibes here. Is your father expecting to give a toast? It might be necessary to make it clear that you want no surprises.\\nNTA.  That\\'s ridiculous to even ask.  This is a wedding, not an open mic night.\\nNTA. Sounds like she wants the attention, it is YOUR wedding, YOUR day, not her day, or your dads day. Sing something in private, unless she is Beyoncé...Always allow Beyoncé.\\nYikes NTA. What an inappropriate request! It doesn\\'t matter what her reasons for wanting to sing are, it\\'s your wedding. You are fully entitled to only have the people you care about and love stand up to say something. You dad should be happy you\\'re so cool about him bringing a woman you\\'ve never met as his +1.\\nSounds about right. NTA.\\nDon\\'t let him give you an ultimatum on your day just so he can get laid.\\nYeah. The rehearsal dinner is a better place for this sorta thing. You don’t know her. The dad should understand\\nFuck no. NTA.\\nNTA - she doesn\\'t get to sing at your wedding as you don\\'t know her and YOU are the focus of attention that day - not her!\\nNTA - \\n\\n&gt;\\'reception or nothing\\' \\n\\nOk, then nothing please.\\ndkfnskchsjsksk THIS!!! nta\\nNTA - Your dad is beyond ridiculous, and she shouldn\\'t sing at *any* part of your wedding.\\nNTA.\\n\\nBut it would make the reception memorable no matter which way it goes.  If shes good it will be remembered as a classy touch.  If she\\'s horrible you have something to laugh over for years to come.\\nNTA - That\\'s a mighty crazy demand, especially considering you don\\'t even know her.\\nFamous or not she has not right to demand anything of OP.\\nNTA but you\\'re gonna regret it when you find out your Dad is dating Adele\\nNTA.  \\n  \\n&gt;I was met with \\'reception or nothing.\\'   \\n  \\nI guess it\\'s nothing then!  Don\\'t feel bad about this at all OP.\\nNTA, this is seriously weird.  I don\\'t even understand why she would WANT to sing at your wedding, unless A) your dad is trying to set this up on his own or B) your dad\\'s new girlfriend is Trisha Paytas or someone similarly attention-starved.  \\n  \\nEven if you said OK, the entire wedding is going to be wondering who the fuck this random lady singing is and it\\'s going to be awkward as hell.  Tell whoever\\'s running the mics at your reception in advance to cut them if this chick tries to force it.\\nOh, I totally agree. I was just racking my brain to figure out why the hell anyone would begin to consider to think suggesting, let alone demanding, something like this. Literally the only thing I could think of was if it was like Beyonce or something.\\nNTA!!!  You\\'re 100% right. It\\'s an attention thing. Dont go through with it. Unless hes dating Mariah Carey or the late great whitney Houston and I\\'m not sure which is more likely. NOOOOO.\\nShe can sing at her own parties. OP doesn\\'t owe her anything.\\nNTA ---- plus, your dad is being a jerk\\\\*  \\n\\n\\n\\\\*with all due respect\\nNTA- Lord is your dad mental?\\nTell your dad now is not the time for both an introduction to his new girlfriend and for her to take front and centre lime light at your wedding \\n\\nUnless he is casually hooking up with Adele - it\\'s inappropriate \\n\\nTell your dad, your happy to meet her - your own wedding is not the usual setting where one would meet their fathers new girlfriend and explain most people you know wouldn\\'t let a new girlfriend come at all. You appreciate the thought but then isn\\'t the time.\\nNTA. Jesus, is she going to wear white too?\\nNTA. It’s your wedding and in my opinion, it’s weird that someone would insist on singing for someone else in any circumstance. I’m willing to bet she’s no Celine Dion level singer either so just, weird. Nope, I wouldn’t want her singing at my wedding either. But you have to let her down easy. No sense in starting a stupid war over it, but it’s your wedding so you get to make all the choices. Maybe just tell her that you want to make all the choices on your special day and that you’re happy to have her come and enjoy what you picked out rather than having to perform. \\n\\nMy dad also recently got married after being single for like 20 years. His wife also pulls the same kind of stuff, like just being super affectionate when I haven’t met her except on FaceTime. She tells me she loves me. It’s weird but I guess it could be worse.\\nNTA - Unless your Dad is dating Dolly Parton, (but she\\'s married so he\\'s not) the answer is NO\\n\\n\\'reception or nothing\\' INDEED!  \\nLooking like a whole lot of nothing then, Pops\\nNTA tell her to go to a fricken karaoke bar if she wants to be the center of attention\\nAlso - seeing as he clearly has no clue about wedding etiquette make sure he doesn\\'t have any plans for them to turn up in white or do a proposal at the wedding or any such shite!\\nInfo: Might sound weird, but is she Vietnamese? At Vietnamese weddings, karaoke during reception is expected, and people sing classic songs/fun songs to celebrate the new couple.\\nmaybe if she were Aretha Franklin raised up AND you\\'d met her and approved her song choice\\n\\notherwise, fuck right off.\\n\\nor... or, \"Thank you for the kind offer. We\\'ve got everything already worked out.\"\\n“What a shame she won’t be singing, Dad. It would have been nice if we could make that work.”\\nNTA, it’s your wedding and your rules. If this stranger because let’s be real this is your first time meeting her, she’s a stranger, wants to sing at your wedding you’re allowed to feel uncomfortable with it and say no. Your dad is being TA by insisting, refusing to even compromise, and not telling girlfriend her offer is super inappropriate\\nNTA - \"reception or nothing\"...ok, Nothing.\\nI wouldn’t even let her sing at the rehearsal dinner.  OP hasn’t even met her yet, and dad and this woman want her to play a huge role in OP’s wedding activities? Absolutely fucking not.\\nNTA. There are a few things I want to mention to you about this whole situation. You don’t know her, and you don’t know what song she’ll sing. She could be a psycho who sings some sort of song to spite your mom or is incredibly inappropriate for the occasion. Next, your dad is an incredible asshole to say she has to sing or he won’t be happy. This day isn’t about his happiness, it’s about yours. If this will make you feel at all uncomfortable then just say a hard no. \\n\\nI had some oddities at my wedding. One was that my moms friend (whom I’ve known my whole life) sang towards the end of the reception when many guests had left and everyone else left was pretty drunk so it wasn’t too bad (she also sings professionally and did a nice job of it so I didn’t mind). If you are gonna fold to this request to keep the peace, you set the terms of what she sings and when she sings it. By late In The party the videographer is gone and people don’t care as much about what is happening as long as they can dance! But don’t let her say she’s gonna sing your first dance song or your father daughter dance song. This day isn’t about her. \\nThe second weird thing is that we also allowed loved ones to bring significant others. Because of this I now have many wedding photos with a newly minted gay porn star. He wasn’t when he came to the wedding, but he and my Besty broke up soon after the wedding, so now I have forever memories of my wedding that I find but hilarious and sad (sad only because this guy had a serious spiral into ALOT of pornography). \\n\\nIt’s your day, not your dads, and certainly not his girlfriend.\\nNTA, “What do you mean reception or nothing? I guess if those are my options, nothing, she will not be welcome if she can not stand to only attend. Do I need to tell her this, or should I?” Even if your dad is dating Adele, this is not appropriate\\nNope.  No f’ing way.   This would be my hill to die on.   \\n\\nNTA.\\nNTA. The only time I haven\\'t cringed when someone was singing at an event was when a friend was singing at his father\\'s funeral, and he\\'s a professional opera singer. Is she a professional singer?\\nNTA, that\\'s just weird. It\\'s like she wants the spotlight immediately and at the most inappropriate time. In no universe are you the asshole here.\\nRescind his invite entirely.\\nDing ding ding!  That\\'s exactly what this is. NTA OP.\\nNTA Please remind your father that this is YOUR day and that should he ever marry his gf then she is more than welcome to sing on her own wedding day.\\nNTA. I would take the nothing.\\nNTA. Ask the DJ to play some trophy wife song and dedicate it to her. \\n\\n(Just kidding on the last part)\\nYeah, it would be great to phrase it that way.\\n\\n\"Thanks for your generous offer of arranging for a stranger to sing at our wedding for free, but don\\'t bother, we actually did not plan to hire a stranger to sing at our wedding as part of the program because we don\\'t want a wedding singer, so you won\\'t really be saving us any expense.\"\\nWhat if he\\'s dating Mariah Carey\\nNTA. If you don’t want her to sing at YOUR wedding it’s your choice and no one can change that\\nNTA. \\n\\n*You* plan your wedding, *you* invite who goes, *you* book the entertainment. Nobody can do some impromptu karaoke for the new bride and groom unless karaoke was part of *your* plan for the reception. Durr. Nobody tells you what does or doesn\\'t happen at *your* wedding.\\nHall &amp; Oates!! That’s actually kind of funny.  But seriously, I’m sorry your Dad’s putting you thru this, and I’m glad he told you about the “surprise” so you could stop it.\\nNTA \\n\\nI\\'d tell them nothing it is then.\\nNTA your dad should see this as a big red flag\\nNTA Unless she is a super famous singer that you totally adore. Otherwise she is an attention seeking moron looking for a reason to upstage a family moment.\\n&gt;explain most people you know wouldn\\'t let a new girlfriend come at all.\\n\\nDon\\'t do this. I understand the intention behind it, but it\\'ll most likely come off as, \"You\\'re lucky I\\'m even allowing you bring her.\" Which may or may not be true, but it won\\'t help the situation.\\nStill nothing because it\\'s oPs wedding and she and her new husband deserve to be the center of attention at the reception.\\nYour dad is mental for even going along with this craziness.  What kind of person decides to \"gift\" a total stranger their personal karaoke at said strangers reception? The gf is clearly unhinged, not to mention attempting to be an attention whore for thinking this was a reasonable idea. NTA - your dad is for endorsing it, and his gf is just straight up crazy for thinking this would be a nice, \"surprise, \".\\nNTA. Tell Daddy she can sing at his wedding if he ever marries her!!\\nNTA yikes. No thanks. You don’t know her and she’s doing it for attention not a special meaningful gift because she’s never even met you. Too bad dad. She can sing at their wedding or nothing )\\nNTA, this is your wedding, not a talent show.\\nOmg definitely NTA. it\\'s YOUR wedding. Tell him you\\'ll happily take the \\'nothing\\' option\\nNTA What is she *thinking*? That is a horrible horrible idea.\\nLol definitely NTA... you’ve never met her so why should you trust her to sing at your wedding. It’s your wedding, your choice and that’s that.\\nOh No you are NTA.\\n\\nDad and GF are TA.  I cannot believe that they think it is fine for a stranger to sing to you at your wedding.\\nsmells like a violation of rule 8\\nWow. Sounds like she is determined to get into the spotlight, even if it\\'s at your expense.  F**k her AND your dad for endorsing her psycho \"gift\".\\nNTA! That is so attention seeking, especially when you don’t even know her! Demanding the reception slot shows it is not a gift, it is an imposition.\\nThis is a good point. Stop this madness before it takes hold!  Rescind your father\\'s plus one if you have to and save your sanity.\\nYou mean the person wanting to do the thing you don’t even want them to do will only do it if their specific unreasonable demands are met? Ohhhh, too bad they won’t be able to do the thing you didn’t even fucking want them to do. NTA.\\nr/ihadastroke ?\\n&gt; \\'reception or nothing.\\' \\n\\nNothing, then. Ultimatums always lose, in my opinion.\\n\\nNTA in any way.\\nNTA.  It\\'s your wedding, you get to decide.  Tell her no.  You may also want to warn your DJ/Band/Wedding planner or anyone who might have access to a microphone that she might try something even without your permission so they can shut it down.\\nNTA OP’s dad’s gf is clearly Jenna Maroney from 30 Rock\\nNTA\\n\\nI like that you provided your dad with some alternatives and didn\\'t shut him down outright. You\\'re not being unreasonable. The only thing we\\'re missing is the manner in which had this conversation. Was it a mature convo? Was it said in passing? Half joking? Was there yelling?\\n\\nMaybe call his bluff for kicks?\\nYour post has been removed.\\n\\nThis post violates part of Rule 8: Don\\'t submit stories where you are obviously NOT the asshole.
